The purpose of this program is to analyze real time information 
from a League of Legends game anywhere around the world.

Ultimately, the program would tell us which team is more likely to win
by using a long, smart algorithm that takes in nearly 90% of the
factors in a game.

API Key is constantly changed upon display of the program.
-------------------------------------------------------
We were stuck with a "bug" for more than 3 hours. Unfortunately, we found out
that we are only allowed to do a certain amount of calls to the main API we were
trying to use. With this limit being present, we were unable to further test the
program and actually develop the algorithm to analyze the data since we did not know
what the data looked like. We ran out of limits by testing if the calling was working.
